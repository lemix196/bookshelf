<h3>Bookshelf - 7-day challenge in Django</h3>

I created that app as a challenge in 7 days (only in after-work-time of course ;)). It may act as private database of books for user with all of the CRUD operations
but also offers API generating .json-type response from all the added records. It has also simple Django searching engine and Google Books API import by keywords function.
